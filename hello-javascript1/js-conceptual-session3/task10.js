Finding Prime Numbers Using Factorization
Factorisation is the best way to find prime numbers. The steps involved in using the factorisation method are:

Step 1: First find the factors of the given number
Step 2: Check the number of factors of that number
Step 3: If the number of factors is more than two, it is not a prime number.

Now, 36 can be written as 2 × 3 × 2 × 3.  So, the factors of 36 here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12,
18, and 36. Since the number of factors of
36 is more than 2, it is not a prime number but a composite number.

Now, if we take the example of 19. The prime factorisation of 19 is 1 x 19. 
You can see here, there are two factors of 19. 
Hence, it is a prime number.

But, Why is 1 Not a Composite Number?
The answer to this also lies in the definition of composite numbers. 
According to the definition, a composite number is a natural number which more than two positive factors. 
But, 1 has only 1 factor i.e. 1 itself. 
So, one is not a composite number.
